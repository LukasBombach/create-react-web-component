# Create React Web Component

This package a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to create a web component with React.

All the magic happens in the `react-web-component-react-scripts` package, [find it here](https://github.com/WeltN24/create-react-web-component/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).

Apart from generating a web component instead of a single page application everything works the same as in Create React App. Please refer to these repos / documentations for further details:
